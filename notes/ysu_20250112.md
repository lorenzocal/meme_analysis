## Project exploration
### Image captioning
I created a script to try out the `image_captioning.py` script. Below is the output of one run:

Processing meme category: Distracted boyfriend
Processing image: 9e6klo.jpg
Caption generated: The image is a meme featuring three young people walking on a busy street. On the left side of the image, there is a young woman wearing a red dress and smiling at the camera. She appears to be in a hurry, while on the right side, there are two young women, one wearing a blue tank top and the other wearing a white tank top. The man in the middle is wearing a plaid shirt and has a serious expression on his face. The text on the image reads "TRUMP USA" and "Making Canada 51st State."

The minifigure on the left is wearing a red apron and has a big smile on her face. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a living room with a couch and a coffee table. On the right side of the image, there is text that reads "Using the actual LEGO template" and "Me the regular template."

### Meme analysis (get_meaning.py)

Below is the output of the `run_meme_analysis.py` script.
Processing meme category: Distracted boyfriend
Processing image: 9e6klo.jpg
Caption generated: The image is a meme featuring three young people walking on a busy street. On the left side of the image, there is a young woman wearing a red dress and smiling at the camera. She appears to be in a hurry, while on the right side, there are two young women, one wearing a blue tank top and the other wearing a white tank top. The man in the middle is wearing a plaid shirt and has a serious expression on his face. The text on the image reads "TRUMP USA" and "Making Canada 51st State."
Meaning generated: The meme depicts a contrast: a cheerful woman seemingly oblivious to the serious man and his companions.  The text, "TRUMP USA" and "Making Canada 51st State," suggests the man represents a Trump supporter's ambition for US annexation of Canada. The cheerful woman is juxtaposed to represent either blissful ignorance of this political goal,  or possibly Canadians unconcerned by it.  The humor lies in the absurdity of the political idea and the incongruity of the characters' expressions.

Caption generated: The image is a meme featuring two Lego minifigures, one with brown hair and the other with blonde hair. The minifigure on the left is wearing a red apron and has a big smile on her face. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a living room with a couch and a coffee table. On the right side of the image, there is text that reads "Using the actual LEGO template" and "Me the regular template."
Meaning generated: The meme contrasts two Lego minifigures: one perfectly constructed using the official Lego template (blonde hair, clean build), representing flawless work, and another (brown hair, red apron, slightly messy), representing a more typical, imperfect, but still charming handmade creation.  It humorously highlights the difference between meticulously following instructions and a more relaxed, personal approach.  The implied message is that while the official template is perfect, the "regular" version has its own endearing appeal.



Processing meme category: Take my money
Processing image: coinsLuigi (1).png
Caption generated: The image is a cartoon illustration of the character Luigi from the video game Super Mario Bros. He is wearing his signature green cap with the letter "L" on it and a blue overall with yellow buttons. He has a big smile on his face and is holding a brown bag of coins in his right hand. The background is blue and there is text above and below the image that reads "Shut up and take-a-my coins!"
Meaning generated: The meme plays on Luigi's typically timid personality.  Instead of his usual anxious demeanor, he's gleefully offering a bag of coins.  The phrase "Shut up and take-a-my coins!" is ironically enthusiastic, suggesting a sudden, unexpected generosity or perhaps a sarcastic resignation to giving up his money.  The humor lies in the contrast between Luigi's happy expression and the brusque, slightly aggressive command.

Caption generated: The image is a meme featuring the character Fry from the animated TV show Futurama. Fry is shown holding a bunch of US dollar bills in his right hand and has a surprised expression on his face. The text on the image reads "Shut up and take my money!"
Meaning generated: The meme uses Fry's surprised reaction to humorously express overwhelming enthusiasm for something.  Seeing a wad of cash, he's so eager to buy it he silences any objections.  "Shut up and take my money!" conveys impulsive, uncritical excitement to purchase an item, regardless of price. The meme applies to anything highly desirable, replacing the money with the object of desire.

## Experimentation with Chinese captioning/vision models

I tried a few image to text models (Qwen-VL, QvQ, and Kimi) to see if they could generate captions for the images in the dataset. However, these models seem to censor automatically certain memes like the "Distracted boyfriend" meme. 

The current plan is to use multimodal models like GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet to directly generate image captions and OCR in Chinese. Then use the Chinese frame semantic transformer to extract frames from the analysis.
